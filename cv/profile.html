        <div><span class="cats">What I did before the bootcamp :</span>
            <p>
                Before the bootcamp, I was a polisher for Quality Gold INC,
                a jewelry manufactering company. I would remove scratches and 
                imperfections, utilized motor wheels and buffer wheels, to polish and make jewelry shine

        <div><span class="cats">Why I decided to join the bootcamp :</span>
            <p>
                I decided to join the bootcamp because I've always had a fascination for coding,
                although I wasn't into taking a college course, and I didnt have the tools to learn myself,
                and come december 2021 a buddy of mine who is also participating in this bootcamp, Corey Meyer, 
                told me about MAX and what it has to offer and introduced me to Kevin at MAX.

        <p>
            What life has been like for me inside of the bootcamp :
            Life for me inside the bootcamp so far has been great, I've been learning a lot,
            getting to know new people, applying what i learn in daily projects and labs 
            and every day we learn something new. its been a great experience. I have had some 
            moments that were stressful, gave me headaches, and not everything was easy.
            However along with Greg's help and MAX's staff's help we're moving along in the bootcamp
            and I am even picking things up now that i didnt quite understand in the beginning of the bootcamp!

    <div><span class="cats">How I feel about leaving the bootcamp and making
        a career out of software development :</span>
        <p>
            I am super excited, i really like coding and it gives me a thrill. Solving puzzles, creating web pages,
            debugging, the all you can learn buffet coding has to offer. This is a great time to be a software developer,
            and i am so fortunate to have gotten this chance to learn through max technical training and i encourage 
            those who would like to learn to do the same. I'll be graduating from the bootcamp in April and starting my new job sometime thereafter,
            and boy i cannot wait! I will bring everything i know with me to the company and I will come ready and prepared to
            learn even more. Thank you max!
